      <br> FOREWORD
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lysistrata</i> is the greatest work by Aristophanes. This blank and
      rash statement is made that it may be rejected. But first let it be
      understood that I do not mean it is a better written work than the <i>Birds</i>
      or the <i>Frogs</i>, or that (to descend to the scale of values that will
      be naturally imputed to me) it has any more appeal to the collectors of
      "curious literature" than the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i> or the <i>Thesmophoriazusae</i>.
      On the mere grounds of taste I can see an at least equally good case made
      out for the <i>Birds</i>. That brightly plumaged fantasy has an aerial wit
      and colour all its own. But there are certain works in which a man finds
      himself at an angle of vision where there is an especially felicitous
      union of the aesthetic and emotional elements which constitute the basic
      qualities of his uniqueness. We recognize these works as being welded into
      a strange unity, as having a homogeneous texture of ecstasy over them that
      surpasses any aesthetic surface of harmonic colour, though that harmony
      also is understood by the deeper welling of imagery from the core of
      creative exaltation. And I think that this occurs in <i>Lysistrata</i>.
      The intellectual and spiritual tendrils of the poem are more truly
      interwoven, the operation of their centres more nearly unified; and so the
      work goes deeper into life. It is his greatest play because of this,
      because it holds an intimate perfume of femininity and gives the finest
      sense of the charm of a cluster of girls, the sweet sense of their
      chatter, and the contact of their bodies, that is to be found before
      Shakespeare, because that mocking gaiety we call Aristophanies reaches
      here its most positive acclamation of life, vitalizing sex with a deep
      delight, a rare happiness of the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it is precisely for these reasons that it is <i>not</i> considered
      Aristophanes' greatest play.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take a case which is sufficiently near to the point in question, to
      make clear what I mean: the supremacy of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in
      the Shakespearean aesthetic is yet jealously disputed, and it seems silly
      to the academic to put it up against a work like <i>Hamlet</i>. But it is
      the comparatively more obvious achievement of <i>Hamlet</i>, its surface
      intellectuality, which made it the favourite of actors and critics. It is
      much more difficult to realize the complex and delicately passionate edge
      of the former play's rhythm, its tides of hugely wandering emotion, the
      restless, proud, gay, and agonized reaction from life, of the blood, of
      the mind, of the heart, which is its unity, than to follow the relatively
      straightforward definition of Hamlet's nerves. Not that anything
      derogatory to <i>Hamlet</i> or the <i>Birds</i> is intended; but the value
      of such works is not enhanced by forcing them into contrast with other
      works which cover deeper and wider nexus of aesthetic and spiritual
      material. It is the very subtlety of the vitality of such works as <i>Antony
      and Cleopatra</i> and <i>Lysistrata</i> that makes it so easy to
      undervalue them, to see only a phallic play and political pamphlet in one,
      only a chronicle play in a grandiose method in the other. For we have to
      be in a highly sensitized condition before we can get to that subtle point
      where life and the image mix, and so really perceive the work at all;
      whereas we can command the response to a lesser work which does not call
      so finely on the full breadth and depth of our spiritual resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      I amuse myself at times with the fancy that Homer, Sappho, and
      Aristophanes are the inviolable Trinity of poetry, even to the extent of
      being reducible to One. For the fiery and lucid directness of Sappho, if
      her note of personal lyricism is abstracted, is seen to be an element of
      Homer, as is the profoundly balanced humour of Aristophanes, at once
      tenderly human and cruelly hard, as of a god to whom all sympathies and
      tolerances are known, but who is invulnerable somewhere, who sees from a
      point in space where the pressure of earth's fear and pain, and so its
      pity, is lifted. It is here that the Shakespearean and Homeric worlds
      impinge and merge, not to be separated by any academic classifications.
      They meet in this sensitivity equally involved and aloof, sympathetic and
      arrogant, suffering and joyous; and in this relation we see Aristophanes
      as the forerunner of Shakespeare, his only one. We see also that the whole
      present aesthetic of earth is based in Homer. We live and grow in the
      world of consciousness bequeathed to us by him; and if we grow beyond it
      through deeper Shakespearean ardours, it is because those beyond are
      rooted in the broad basis of the Homeric imagination. To shift that basis
      is to find the marshes of primitive night and fear alone beneath the feet:
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here we return to the question of the immorality of <i>Lysistrata</i>.
      First we may inquire: is it possible for a man whose work has so
      tremendous a significance in the spiritual development of mankind--and I
      do not think anyone nowadays doubts that a work of art is the sole
      stabilizing force that exists for life--is it possible for a man who
      stands so grandly at head of an immense stream of liberating effort to
      write an immoral work? Surely the only enduring moral virtue which can be
      claimed is for that which moves to more power, beauty and delight in the
      future? The plea that the question of changing customs arises is not
      valid, for customs ratified by Aristophanes, by Rabelais, by Shakespeare,
      have no right to change. If they have changed, let us try immediately to
      return from our disgraceful refinements to the nobler and more rarefied
      heights of lyric laughter, tragic intensity, and wit, for we cannot have
      the first two without the last. And anyhow, how can a social custom claim
      precedence over the undying material of the senses and the emotions of
      man, over the very generating forces of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      How could the humanistic emotions, such as pity, justice, sympathy, exist
      save as pacifistic quietings of the desire to slay, to hurt, to torment.
      Where the desire to hurt is gone pity ceases to be a significant, a
      central emotion. It must of course continue to exist, but it is displaced
      in the spiritual hierarchy; and all that moves courageously, desirously,
      and vitally into the action of life takes on a deeper and subtler
      intention. Lust, then, which on the lower plane was something to be very
      frightened of, becomes a symbol of the highest spirituality. It is right
      for Paul to be terrified of sex and so to hate it, because he has so
      freshly escaped a bestial condition of life that it threatens to plunge
      him back if he listens to one whisper But it is also right for a
      Shakespeare to suck every drop of desire from life, for he is building
      into a higher condition, one self-willed, self- responsible, the
      discipline of which comes from joy, not fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sex, therefore, is an animal function, one admits, one insists; it may be
      only that. But also in the bewildering and humorous and tragic duality of
      all life's energies, it is the bridge to every eternity which is not
      merely a spectral condition of earth disembowelled of its lusts. For sex
      holds the substance of the image. But we must remember with Heine that
      Aristophanes is the God of this ironic earth, and that all argument is
      apparently vitiated from the start by the simple fact that Wagner and a
      rooster are given an analogous method of making love. And therefore it
      seems impeccable logic to say that all that is most unlike the rooster is
      the most spiritual part of love. All will agree on that, schisms only
      arise when one tries to decide what does go farthest from the bird's
      automatic mechanism. Certainly not a Dante-Beatrice affair which is only
      the negation of the rooster in terms of the swooning bombast of
      adolescence, the first onslaught of a force which the sufferer cannot
      control or inhabit with all the potentialities of his body and soul. But
      the rooster is troubled by no dreams of a divine orgy, no carnival-loves
      like Beethoven's <i>Fourth Symphony</i>, no heroic and shining lust
      gathering and swinging into a merry embrace like the third act of <i>Siegfried</i>.
      It is desire in this sense that goes farthest from the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consciously, no one can achieve the act of love on earth as a completed
      thing of grace, with whatever delirium of delight, with whatever ingenious
      preciosity, we go through its process. Only as an image of beauty mated in
      some strange hermaphroditic ecstasy is that possible. I mean only as a
      dream projected into a hypothetical, a real heaven. But on earth we cannot
      complete the cycle in consciousness that would give us the freedom of an
      image in which two identities mysteriously realize their separate unities
      by the absorption of a third thing, the constructive rhythm of a work of
      art. It is thus that Tristan and Isolde become wholly distinct
      individuals, yet wholly submerged in the unity that is Wagner; and so
      reconcile life's duality by balancing its opposing laughters in a definite
      form--thereby sending out into life a profounder duality than existed
      before. A Platonic equipoise, Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence--the only
      real philosophic problem, therefore one of which these two philosophers
      alone are aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Wagner with Mathilde Wesendonck in his arms was Tristan in the
      arms of Isolde, he did not find a melody instead of a kiss on his lips; he
      did not find a progression of harmonies melting through the contours of a
      warm beauty with a blur of desperate ecstasies, semitones of desire, he
      found only the anxious happiness of any other lover. Nevertheless, he was
      gathering the substance of the second act of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>.
      And it is this that Plato means when he says that fornication is something
      immortal in mortality. He does not mean that the act itself is a godlike
      thing, a claim which any bedroom mirror would quickly deride. He means
      that it is a symbol, an essential condition, and a part of something that
      goes deeper into life than any geometry of earth's absurd, passionate,
      futile, and very necessary antics would suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a universal fallacy that because works like the comedies of
      Aristophanes discuss certain social or ethical problems, they are inspired
      by them. Aristophanes wrote to express his vision on life, his delight in
      life itself seen behind the warping screen of contemporary event; and for
      his purposes anything from Euripides to Cleon served as ground work. Not
      that he would think in those terms, naturally: but the rationalizing
      process that goes on in consciousness during the creation of a work of
      art, for all its appearance of directing matters, is the merest
      weathercock in the wind of the subconscious intention. As an example of
      how utterly it is possible to misunderstand the springs of inspiration in
      a poem, we may take the following remark of B. B. Rogers: <i>It is much to
      be regretted that the phallus element should be so conspicuous in this
      play.... (This) coarseness, so repulsive to ourselves, was introduced, it
      is impossible to doubt, for the express purpose of counter-balancing the
      extreme earnestness and gravity of the play</i>. It seems so logical, so
      irrefutable; and so completely misinterprets every creative force of
      Aristophanes' Psyche that it certainly deserves a little admiration. It is
      in the best academic tradition, and everyone respects a man for writing so
      mendaciously. The effort of these castrators is always to show that the
      parts considered offensive are not the natural expression of the poet,
      that they are dictated externally. They argue that Shakespeare's
      coarseness is the result of the age and not personal predilection,
      completely ignoring the work of men like Sir Philip Sidney and Spenser,
      indeed practically all the pre-Shakespearean writers, in whom none of this
      so-called grossness exists. Shakespeare wrote sculduddery because he liked
      it, and for no other reason; his sensuality is the measure of his
      vitality. These liars pretend similarly that because Rabelais had a
      humanistic reason for much of his work--the destructior Mediaevalism, and
      the Church, which purpose they construe of course as an effort to purify,
      etc.--therefore he only put the lewdery to make the rest palatable, when
      it should be obvious even to an academic how he glories in his wild
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the academic cannot understand is that in such works, while attacking
      certain conditions, the creative power of the vigorous spirits is so great
      that it overflows and saturates the intellectual conception with their own
      passionate sense of life. It is for this reason that these works have an
      eternal significance. If Rabelais were merely a social reformer, then the
      value of his work would not have outlived his generation. If <i>Lysistrata</i>
      were but a wise political tract, it would have merely an historical
      interest, and it would have ceased spiritually at 404 B.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Panurge is as fantastic and fascinating a character now as he was 300
      years ago, Lysistrata and her girls as freshly bodied as any girl kissed
      to-day. Therefore the serious part of the play is that which deals with
      them, the frivolous part that in which Rogers detects gravity and
      earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristophanes is the lord of all who take life as a gay adventure, who defy
      all efforts to turn life into a social, economic, or moral abstraction. Is
      it therefore just that the critics who, by some dark instinct, unerringly
      pick out the exact opposite of any creator's real virtues as his chief
      characteristics, should praise him as an idealistic reformer? An "ideal"
      state of society was the last thing Aristophanes desired. He wished,
      certainly, to eliminate inhumanities and baseness; but only that there
      might be free play for laughter, for individual happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently the critics lay the emphasis on the effort to cleanse
      society, not the method of laughter. Aristophanes wished to destroy Cleon
      because that demagogue failed to realize the poet's conception of
      dignified government and tended to upset the stability of Hellas. But it
      was the stability of life, the vindication of all individual freedoms, in
      which he was ultimately interested.

    </p>
    <p>
      Make room, Draces, move ahead; why your shoulder's chafed, I see,<br>
      With lugging uphill these lopped branches of the olive-tree.<br> How
      upside-down and wrong-way-round a long life sees things grow.<br> Ah,
      Strymodorus, who'd have thought affairs could tangle so?
    </p>
    <p>
      The women whom at home we fed,<br> Like witless fools, with fostering
      bread,<br> Have impiously come to this--<br> They've stolen the
      Acropolis,<br> With bolts and bars our orders flout<br> And shut us out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, Philurgus, bustle thither; lay our faggots on the ground,<br> In
      neat stacks beleaguering the insurgents all around;<br> And the vile
      conspiratresses, plotters of such mischief dire,<br> Pile and burn them
      all together in one vast and righteous pyre:<br> Fling with our own hands
      Lycon's wife to fry in the thickest fire.<br> By Demeter, they'll get no
      brag while I've a vein to beat!<br> Cleomenes himself was hurtled out in
      sore defeat.<br> His stiff-backed Spartan pride was bent.<br> Out,
      stripped of all his arms, he went:<br> A pigmy cloak that would not
      stretch<br> To hide his rump (the draggled wretch),<br> Six sprouting
      years of beard, the spilth<br> Of six years' filth.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a siege! Our men were ranged in lines of seventeen deep<br>
      Before the gates, and never left their posts there, even to sleep.<br>
      Shall I not smite the rash presumption then of foes like these,<br>
      Detested both of all the gods and of Euripides--<br> Else, may the
      Marathon-plain not boast my trophied victories!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, now, there's but a little space<br> To reach the place!<br> A deadly
      climb it is, a tricky road<br> With all this bumping load:<br> A
      pack-ass soon would tire....<br> How these logs bruise my shoulders!
      further still<br> Jog up the hill,<br> And puff the fire inside,<br> Or
      just as we reach the top we'll find it's died.<br> Ough, phew!<br> I
      choke with the smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Heracles, how acrid-hot<br> Out of the pot<br> This mad-dog smoke
      leaps, worrying me<br> And biting angrily....<br> 'Tis Lemnian fire that
      smokes,<br> Or else it would not sting my eyelids thus....<br> Haste,
      all of us;<br> Athene invokes our aid.<br> Laches, now or never the
      assault must be made!<br> Ough, phew!<br> I choke with the smoke. ..
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanked be the gods! The fire peeps up and crackles as it should.<br> Now
      why not first slide off our backs these weary loads of wood<br> And dip a
      vine-branch in the brazier till it glows, then straight<br> Hurl it at
      the battering-ram against the stubborn gate?<br> If they refuse to draw
      the bolts in immediate compliance,<br> We'll set fire to the wood, and
      smoke will strangle their defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phew, what a spluttering drench of smoke! Come, now from off my back....<br>
      Is there no Samos-general to help me to unpack?<br> Ah there, that's
      over! For the last time now it's galled my shoulder.<br> Flare up thine
      embers, brazier, and dutifully smoulder,<br> To kindle a brand, that I
      the first may strike the citadel.<br> Aid me, Lady Victory, that a
      triumph-trophy may tell<br> How we did anciently this insane audacity
      quell!

      What's that rising yonder? That ruddy glare, that smoky skurry?<br> O is
      it something in a blaze? Quick, quick, my comrades, hurry!<br> Nicodice,
      helter-skelter!<br> Or poor Calyce's in flames<br> And Cratylla's
      stifled in the welter.<br> O these dreadful old men<br> And their dark
      laws of hate!<br> There, I'm all of a tremble lest I turn out to be too
      late.<br> I could scarcely get near to the spring though I rose before
      dawn,<br> What with tattling of tongues and rattling of pitchers in one
      jostling din<br> With slaves pushing in!....

      Still here at last the water's drawn<br> And with it eagerly I run<br>
      To help those of my friends who stand<br> In danger of being burned
      alive.<br> For I am told a dribbling band<br> Of greybeards hobble to
      the field,<br> Great faggots in each palsied hand,<br> As if a hot bath
      to prepare,<br> And threatening that out they'll drive<br> These wicked
      women or soon leave them charring into ashes<br> there.<br> O Goddess,
      suffer not, I pray, this harsh deed to be done,<br> But show us Greece
      and Athens with their warlike acts repealed!<br> For this alone, in this
      thy hold,<br> Thou Goddess with the helm of gold,<br> We laid hands on
      thy sanctuary,<br> Athene.... Then our ally be<br> And where they cast
      their fires of slaughter<br> Direct our water!

      broke open. Now I'm off for Salamis;<br> If you've the leisure, would you
      go tonight<br> And stick a bolt-pin into her opened clasp."<br> Another
      goes to a cobbler; a soldierly fellow,<br> Always standing up erect, and
      says to him,<br> "Cobbler, a sandal-strap of my wife's pinches her,<br>
      Hurts her little toe in a place where she's sensitive.<br> Come at noon
      and see if you can stretch out wider<br> This thing that troubles her,
      loosen its tightness."<br> And so you view the result. Observe my case--<br>
      I, a magistrate, come here to draw<br> Money to buy oar-blades, and what
      happens?<br> The women slam the door full in my face.<br> But standing

      Lampito's with me.<br> Or dear Ismenia, the noble Theban girl. Then let
      decree<br> Be hotly piled upon decree; in vain will be your labours,<br>
      You futile rogue abominated by your suffering neighbour<br> To Hecate's
      feast I yesterday went.<br> Off I sent<br> To our neighbours in Boeotia,
      asking as a gift to me<br> For them to pack immediately<br> That darling
      dainty thing ... a good fat eel [1] I meant of course;

      But they refused because some idiotic old decree's in force.<br> O this
      strange passion for decrees nothing on earth can check,<br> Till someone
      puts a foot out tripping you,<br> and slipping you<br> Break your neck.

      Most likely he's there yet.<br> For he never came back home, so great was
      the fear he felt.<br> I loathe the sex as much as he,<br> And therefore

      By all the gods, then call Myrrhine hither.

      Welcome, dear friend! That glorious name of yours<br> Is quite familiar
      in our ranks. Your wife<br> Continually has it in her mouth.<br> She
      cannot touch an apple or an egg<br> But she must say, "This to Cinesias!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      CINESIAS
    </p>
    <p>
      O is that true?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      LYSISTRATA
    </p>
    <p>
      By Aphrodite, it is.<br> If the conversation strikes on men, your wife<br>
      Cuts in with, "All are boobies by Cinesias."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      CINESIAS
    </p>
    <p>
      Then call her here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      LYSISTRATA
    </p>
    <p>
      And what am I to get?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      CINESIAS
    </p>
    <p>
      This, if you want it.... See, what I have here.<br> But not to take away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      LYSISTRATA
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I'll call her.

    <p>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      CINESIAS
    </p>
    <p>
      Be quick, be quick. All grace is wiped from life<br> Since she went away.
      O sad, sad am I<br> When there I enter on that loneliness,<br> And wine
      is unvintaged of the sun's flavour.<br> And food is tasteless. But I've
      put on weight.

      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      MYRRHINE

      Lift up your lovely face, your disdainful face;<br> And your ankle ...
      let your scorn step out its worst;<br> It only rubs me to more ardor

      How wrong to follow other women's counsel<br> And let loose all these

      No, by Apollo, in spite of all your faults<br> I won't have you lying on

      An easy task if the love's raging home-sickness<br> Doesn't start trying

      first before me the Spartan delegates,<br> And see you lift no rude or
      violent hands--<br> None of the churlish ways our husbands used.<br> But
      lead them courteously, as women should.<br> And if they grudge fingers,
      guide them by other methods,<br> And introduce them with ready tact. The

      stay here facing me. Here you,<br> Athenians. Both hearken to my words.<br>
      I am a woman, but I'm not a fool.<br> And what of natural intelligence I
      own<br> Has been filled out with the remembered precepts<br> My father
      and the city-elders taught me.<br> First I reproach you both sides
      equally<br> That when at Pylae and Olympia,<br> At Pytho and the many
      other shrines<br> That I could name, you sprinkle from one cup<br> The
      altars common to all Hellenes, yet<br> You wrack Hellenic cities, bloody
      Hellas<br> With deaths of her own sons, while yonder clangs<br> The
      gathering menace of barbarians.

      altars, pale in his purple robes,<br> Praying for an army when in
      Messenia<br> Danger growled, and the Sea-god made earth quaver.<br> Then
      with four thousand hoplites Cimon marched<br> And saved all Sparta. Yet

      Hippias?<br> They alone stood by your shoulder on that day.<br> They
      freed you, so that for the slave's short skirt<br> You should wear the
      trailing cloak of liberty.
